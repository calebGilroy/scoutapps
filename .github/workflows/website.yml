# Want to see the website on your personal GitHub page?
#
# 1. Go to your personal settings. Mine is https://github.com/jonahbeckford/scoutapps/settings/pages
# 2. Change `Build and deployment > Source` to `GitHub Actions` not `Deploy from a branch`
# 3. Commit and push a change
# 4. You _may_ get an error in the `Deploy` job that looks like:
#       Branch "2025-10-09-bordie" is not allowed to deploy to github-pages due to environment protection rules.
#    If so, go to `Settings > Environments > github-pages` (mine is https://github.com/jonahbeckford/scoutapps/settings/environments)
#    and change `Deployment branches` to include your branch (ex. `2025-*` and `2026-*`).
